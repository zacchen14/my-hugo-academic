Zian Chen (陈子安 in Chinese) is a first-year Ph.D. student at College of control science and engineering, Zhejiang University (ZJU). Before purchasing P.h. D degree, he gained my BSc at ZJU.

His research interests include complex industrial processes modeling, anomaly detection, application of signal processing and machine learning in industry. He leads the Robotic Neurobiology group, which develops self-reconfiguring robots, systems of self-organizing robots, and mobile sensor networks.

At CMU, he works with Prof. Zhengguo Xu from Group of Networked Sensing and Control (NeSC) on PHM, Dr. Xiao-Ping (Steven) Zhang from Ryerson University on signal processing.
